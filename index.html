                        was done by myself. Recession is a 4v1 cop vs. robbers multiplayer shooter. Four robbers attempt
                        to rob a bank full of money bags while a single cop with heavy armor and weapons tries to take
                        all

                        <p>
                            I have been programming since I was in middle school and I couldnâ€™t imagine doing anything
                            else. I'm interested in building
                            cloud applications with excellent user interfaces and user experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My passions include web development, video games, and fitness. I have worked on various
                            games and apps and have experience
                            with many object-oriented languages such as C#, C++, and Java. For the past 2 years I have
                            been
                            programming and designing websites using NodeJS, ASP.NET, and Angular. I am
                            currently
                            employed as an intern at the Ontario Digital Service where my main role is to develop Ontario.ca                            
                            using Drupal 8.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Previously, I have worked as a leader and as a team player. I worked in another role in the Ontario Public Service where
                            I was initially on a team of developers designing cloud applications in Microsoft Azure with ASP.NET and Angular. I eventually
                            began leading part of the team on a few sprints near the end of my term there.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My biggest strength as a programmer is debugging. Making games has taught me how to properly
                            breakpoint my code and run through
                            it step by step to find the most obscure bugs and fix them quickly. Web development taught
                            me
                            how to create great UX and work with clients to fufill their needs for a project.
